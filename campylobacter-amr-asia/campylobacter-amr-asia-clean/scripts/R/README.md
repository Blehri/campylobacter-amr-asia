# R Analysis Scripts

This directory is reserved for R-based analyses if needed.

## Current Status

All analyses in this study were performed using Python. This directory is included for potential future R-based analyses or alternative implementations.

## Adding R Scripts

If you wish to add R equivalents or additional R analyses:

1. Install required R packages:
```r
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "vegan", "ape"))
```

2. Create R scripts following the naming convention:
   - `01_analysis_name.R`
   - Include documentation header
   - Update this README

## Potential R Analyses

Some analyses that could be implemented in R:
- PERMANOVA for phylogenetic distance matrices
- Alternative statistical tests (e.g., using `vegan` package)
- Phylogenetic tree visualization
- Alternative plotting with `ggplot2`
